# Introduction

MACE is a multi-genre role-playing I use to run a variety of tabletop adventure games at meetups and at cons, and as such it has been built around the following features:

1. The game should be able to support a variety of settings. While I typically run some type of fantasy, I am also fond of horror, noir, sci-fi, and historical games.
2. Character creation should be relatively quick, with a few customizations present to players.
3. The system should be familiar and largely intuitive to players of adventure games, allowing referees to easily port in tools from the OSR, NSR, or BRP ecosystems, or adapt modules quickly.
